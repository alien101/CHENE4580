Artificial Intelligence in Chemical Engineering 

Object:
This course is aimed at chemical engineering students to teach them how to 
incorporate AI-based modeling in combination with first-principles-based models derived from the 
understanding of the physics and chemistry (and biology) of our products, processes, and systems. To 
accomplish this, this course will combine the traditional symbolic AI with the more recent data-driven AI. 
In this regard, this course is different from the standard data science course which typically focuses only 
on the data-driven aspect.
