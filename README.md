Artificial Intelligence in Chemical Engineering 

Object:
This course is aimed at chemical engineering students to teach them how to 
incorporate AI-based modeling in combination with first-principles-based models derived from the 
understanding of the physics and chemistry (and biology) of our products, processes, and systems. To 
accomplish this, this course will combine the traditional symbolic AI with the more recent data-driven AI. 
In this regard, this course is different from the standard data science course which typically focuses only 
on the data-driven aspect.

## Final Project
As an electrochemical cell design engineer, we want to be able to model the performance of a cell during its discharge, using a combination of design variables. These include the following:
• CRATE – Discharge Rate (1C means a full theoretical discharge in an hour, 2C means full theoretical discharge in half-an-hour, 1/10C means full theoretical discharge in 10 hours)
• LENGTH – Electrode thickness
• RXNK – Logarithm to the base 10 of the kinetic reaction rate constant for the
forward and backward reaction as defined by Butler Filmed Kinetics
• POROSITY
• EFF_TORTUOSITY – Effective tortuosity
• VFRAC_AM_PERCENT – Volume fraction of active material
• PERCENT_ACTIVE – Fraction of the active material that is reactive
• DIFF_BULK – Bulk diffusivity

The target variable, namely:
• Energy (mWh/g)
